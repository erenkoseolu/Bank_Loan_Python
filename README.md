Loan Prediction using Machine Learning
Project idea – The idea behind this project is to build a model that will classify how much loan the user can take. 
It is based on the user’s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. We can build a linear model for this project.

"Loan Prediction Dataset" has been used.
